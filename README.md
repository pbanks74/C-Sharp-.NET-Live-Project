# Tech-Academy-Projects
While studying at The Tech Academy, I completed several assignments and worked on multiple projects in order to build my skill set and proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, SQL, C# and the .NET framework. I was taught how to think like a programmer in order to find creative solutions while writing clean and precise commented code. Completing these assignments and projects taught me several programming skills and gives me the confidence that I can learn any language or framework fairly quickly.

## C# / .NET Live Project
After completing The Tech Academy's C# and .NET course I was tasked with working with other developers to help develop a new Content Management System(CMS) for a local theatre company. This project was built utilizing ASP.NET MVC, Entity framework and C#. The goal was to create a simple web application that could be managed by those who are not necessarily tech savy. Our team used Microsoft Azure DevOps and practiced SCRUM processes including a daily meeting to discuss progress and roadblocks. This project had already started upon joining, this taught me the importance of quickly becoming famliar with a project and how to get up to speed quickly in order to make sizable contributions.
