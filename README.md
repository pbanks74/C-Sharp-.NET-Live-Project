# Tech-Academy-Projects
While studying at The Tech Academy, I completed several assignments and worked on multiple projects in order to build my skill set and proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Django, SQL, C# and the .NET framework. I was taught how to think like a programmer in order to find creative solutions while writing clean and precise commented code. Completing these assignments and projects taught me several programming skills and gives me the confidence that I can learn any language or framework fairly quickly.
